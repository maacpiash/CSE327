# CSE327 Project: university course registration system

CSE327 is a course on Software Engineering, offered by [North South University](http://www.northsouth.edu/), Dhaka, Bangladesh. This project was completed gradually over the semester. This project's goal was to get familiar with commonly used design patterns of software development.

## Design patterns

The following design patterns are implemented in the project:

- Factory
- Singleton
- Dependency Injection
- Facade
- Observer
- MVC

and a few more (can't remember all of them).

## Stack

.NET Framework (4.5.2), Windows Forms Application, with Microsoft SQL Server. The WinForms app directly communicates with the database.

## Acknowledgement

I am very grateful to [Dr. Shazzad Hossain](http://ece.northsouth.edu/people/shazzad-hosain/), my course instructor for CSE327, for his generous guidance and insightful feedback on the project throughout the course. This project taught me to write better code by adhering to OOP good practices and SOLID principles â€” which made my longest-developing [project](https://github.com/maacpiash/KonSchool) my finest.
